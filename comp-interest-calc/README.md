# Project referring to the discipline of Computational Thinking of the ADS course at CESMAC

The proposed project is to develop a simple application that has the use of variables, conditional structures and repetition. The project should have a maximum of twenty steps.

It will be developed in 3 stages:

- Flowchart construction
- Prototype implementation in Python language
- Inclusion of vectors and/or matrices, refactoring and separation of modules by function.
