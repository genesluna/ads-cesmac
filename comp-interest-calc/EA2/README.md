# Second stage of the project

In the first EA it was decided that the project would be a compound interest calculator. In this second step we will implement the flowchart created in the first EA in Python programming language. This implementation will be a draft, proof of concept, and will not apply good programming practices. Refactoring and best practices will remain for the final code that will be presented in the third EA.
