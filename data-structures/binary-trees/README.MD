# Binary Trees assignment

This assignment aims to enable the student to fully understand the abstraction of how a tree works and be able to implement the code that defines the behavior of a binary tree in the process of inserting and removing data from its structure. As it is a non-linear structure, the way its data is displayed may vary from scenario to scenario. In addition, considering that the use of trees is usually related to searching for values ​​more quickly than a linear structure such as a queue, stack, and list, it is interesting to maintain its balance in order to make this process even faster.

**Based on this information, the assignment consists of building a binary tree following the steps below:**

- Step 1: Build the Base Structure of a Binary Tree in some programming language (A class containing the Node and another containing the structure of the Binary Tree).
- Step 2: Implement the features of inserting data into the binary tree.
- Step 3: Implement the feature of removing data from the binary tree.
- Step 4: Implement at least one of the three processes of displaying the values ​​contained within the binary tree: In-Order, Pre-Order, and Post-Order.
- Extra Step - Ensure that the tree remains balanced during the process of inserting and removing data.
