# Usage example

This example script first inserts values into both tree (BST and AVL)

![Values to be inserted the trees](assets/image01.png "Values to be inserted the trees")

Then it prints the diagrams of both trees with the inserted values

![Diagrams of both trees](assets/image02.png "Diagrams of both trees")

Now it displays the values in-order, pre-order and post-order for both trees

![Diagrams of both trees](assets/image03.png "Diagrams of both trees")

After that, it deletes values from the BST and shows a before and after

![Diagrams of both trees](assets/image04.png "Diagrams of both trees")

And finally, it deletes values from the AVL tree and shows a before and after

![Diagrams of both trees](assets/image05.png "Diagrams of both trees")

All the diagrams are generated from the print_tree_diagram function contained in both trees classes
